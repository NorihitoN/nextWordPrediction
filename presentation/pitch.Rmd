## About

This is an assginment for [Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) course in coursera.

I developed ***Notes with autocompletion***, which is an application to create notes/memos easy.
Autocompletion function helps users to type the next word based on their input words.

The applecation link is:

The source code is:

## How To Use

- Write your note in the text box at the left side bar.
- During writing a note, the next prediction word appears below the text box in 5sec.
- If you click one of the prediction words, the clicked word will be added to the text box. If not needed, coutinue to write by yourself.
- Click "Post" button to add your note to "Memos" list at the main panel.
- Click "Clear" button to clear all your notes.

## Prediction Model

To predict the next words, three-gram method is used, which is the special case of N-gram method.

- Model Building
I sampled 30,000 sentences from blogs/twitters. All sentences are tokenized by R library **quanteda** and are converted to a document-feature matrix, which option `ngrams` equals 3).
By using `textstat_frequency`, I created the dataset which has two columns, `3-gram` and `frequency`.

- Prediction
The next word prediction function is performed based on the dataset built in the above.
The function is
