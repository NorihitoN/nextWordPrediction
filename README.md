# NextWordPrediction

This is the final assignment for [Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) course in coursera.

I developed [***Notes with autocompletion***](https://norihiton.shinyapps.io/NextWordPrediction), which is an application to create notes/memos easy. Autocompletion function helps users to type the next word based on their input words.

## 1. Application

You can access the application from [this link](https://norihiton.shinyapps.io/NextWordPrediction).
I developed the application by using shiny app.
Source code is in `/app` directory.
